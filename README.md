# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver Using Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The TSP is a well-known optimization problem where the objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of locations exactly once and returns to the starting point.

## Features

- **Random Location Generation**: Generates random coordinates for the locations that need to be visited.
- **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**: Uses a genetic algorithm to find an optimal or near-optimal solution for the TSP.
- **Route Visualization**: Plots the optimal route found by the algorithm.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `deap`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib deap
